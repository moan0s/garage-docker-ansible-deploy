# To connect using a non-root user (and elevate to root with sudo later),
# replace `ansible_ssh_user=root` with something like this: `ansible_ssh_user=username become=true become_user=root`
#
# For improved Ansible performance, SSH pipelining is enabled by default (`ansible_ssh_pipelining=yes`).
# If this causes SSH connection troubles, feel free to disable it.
